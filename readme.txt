			<p>If you don't see an immediate change let it sit for a few seconds and then try refreshing the page.</p>
			
			<h2>Theme Layout and Structure</h2>
			<p>Tumblr themes use CSS and HTML markup to setup the structure of a theme by using "blocks" to structure content and to "hook" posts, images, and various things together.</p>
			<p>This theme follows the basic Tumblr "blocks" layout in regard to the structure of how the blog functions.</p>
			
			<p>Below is an example of what the CSS structure looks like</p>
			<p>
			<pre>/*-- BASE STYLES --*/</pre>
			<pre>/*-- SIMPLE RESET --*/</pre>
			<pre>/*-- HEADER STYLES --*/</pre>
			<pre>/*-- SEARCH STYLES --*/</pre>
			<pre>/*-- MENU STYLES --*/</pre>
			<pre>/*-- WRAPPER STYLES --*/</pre>
			<pre>/*-- POST BASE STYLES --*/</pre>
		
			
			<p>Below is how the HTML structure looks</p>
			
			<pre>Header</pre>
			<pre>Nav</pre>
			<pre>Wrapper</pre>
			<pre>Section</pre>
			<pre>Article</pre>
			<pre>Post Meta Data</pre>
			<pre>Comments</pre>
			<pre>Pagination</pre>
			<pre>Footer</pre>
			<pre>Scripts</pre>
			
			<p><img src="http://static.tumblr.com/dsnh5zg/mOZmd3pma/info_layout.png" alt="layout"></p>
			<p>This is what the structure of the site looks like when you view the source code.</p>
