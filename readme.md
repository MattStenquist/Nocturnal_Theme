Editing the CSS 

Please use the {Custom CSS} area within the Customize theme's dashboard.

If you want to get your hand nice and dirty and change the site up manually without using a CSS override, please edit the 
theme.css file (non-compressed) and make the appropriate changes inside. Afterwards, replace the CSS in the .html with your
CSS code using the YUI CSS compressor to keep the theme under 65kb. If you don't need compression just paste in the CSS
and press "Save" and "Update-Preview".
